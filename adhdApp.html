    <h3 id="aim">Aim & Objectives</h3>
    <p>The objective was to develop an inclusive mobile app prototype that supports university students with ADHD. The application focuses on managing tasks, medication, and time while promoting independence and reducing cognitive overload.</p>

    <h4>Key Objectives:</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Understand user needs through inclusive research methods</li>
      <li>Apply iterative, user-centred design practices</li>
      <li>Design an accessible interface promoting routine and focus</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="section-divider"></div>

    <h3 id="problem">Problem & How Might We</h3>
    <p>ADHD affects executive functioning, making task initiation, planning, and follow-through difficult. Through research, the problem was reframed as:</p>
    <p><em>“How might we create a digital tool that supports students with ADHD in managing time, medication and responsibilities through intuitive and supportive design?”</em></p>

    <div class="section-divider"></div>

    <h3 id="research">Research</h3>
    <p>I adopted a mixed-method approach to gather insights:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Desk Research:</strong> Explored ADHD characteristics, medication adherence, and executive function challenges</li>
      <li><strong>Survey:</strong> Distributed to 48 students (25 ADHD-diagnosed) to understand habits, triggers and app usage</li>
      <li><strong>Interviews:</strong> Conducted semi-structured interviews with 3 ADHD students for deeper context</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>Key Findings:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Time blindness, low motivation, and poor organisation were common pain points</li>
      <li>Existing apps lacked personalisation and triggered overstimulation</li>
      <li>Students desired visual structure, soft reminders and flexibility</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="persona-card">
      <p><strong>Name:</strong> Sarah (21)</p>
      <p><strong>Goals:</strong> Manage tasks, stay on schedule, reduce anxiety</p>
      <p><strong>Pain Points:</strong> Overwhelm, forgetfulness, visual distractions</p>
      <p><strong>Quote:</strong> "I know what to do... I just don't know where to start."</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section-divider"></div>

    <h3 id="design">Design Process</h3>
    <p>I followed the Design Thinking model: Empathise, Define, Ideate, Prototype, Test</p>

    <h4>Sketching</h4>
    <p>Rough sketches were developed to explore navigation layouts, dashboard organisation and key features like timers, medication logs and affirmations.</p>

    <h4>Wireframes</h4>
    <p>Low-fidelity wireframes were produced to test flows and content structure. Key feedback included clearer icons, less visual noise, and gentle colour palettes.</p>

    <h4>High-Fidelity Prototypes</h4>
    <p>Figma was used to develop clean, accessible screens. I incorporated chunked timers, custom reminders, calming visuals and smooth transitions.</p>

  <div class="section-divider"></div>

<h3 id="prioritisation">Prioritisation & Planning</h3>

<p>To ensure the solution stayed feasible and aligned with user needs, I used a combined approach of the MoSCoW prioritisation method and risk analysis.</p>

<h4>MoSCoW Method</h4>
<p>The MoSCoW framework (Must have, Should have, Could have, Won’t have) allowed me to classify features based on their impact, urgency, and implementation cost.</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Must have:</strong> Core functionality that enables time tracking, task reminders, and a visual day planner.</li>
  <li><strong>Should have:</strong> Features such as motivational nudges, personalised themes, and accessible navigation tools.</li>
  <li><strong>Could have:</strong> Future additions like gamification and social integration with accountability groups.</li>
  <li><strong>Won’t have (for now):</strong> Complex AI-based scheduling due to resource and timeline limitations.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Gantt Chart</h4>
<p>Development was mapped across phases: Research, Ideation, Design, Testing. Agile sprints allowed iteration after each feedback round.</p>
<div class="image-gallery">
  <img src="images/adhd-gantt-chart.png"alt="Gantt Timeline" class="zoomable">
  <img src="images/moscow.png" alt="MoSCoW Prioritisation" class="zoomable">
</div>
<p>These categories were informed through stakeholder interviews, user questionnaire results, technical feasibility evaluation, and time constraints from the Gantt plan.</p>

<h4>Risk Analysis & Mitigation</h4>
<p>Early in the process, I conducted a simple risk analysis to assess potential challenges across design, technical and user adoption dimensions.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Risk 1: Scope creep</strong> – Solution: Defined MVP tightly using MoSCoW and set boundaries for feature inclusion per sprint.</li>
  <li><strong>Risk 2: User overwhelm</strong> – Solution: Validated prototypes with ADHD users to minimise visual clutter and cognitive load.</li>
  <li><strong>Risk 3: Time limitations</strong> – Solution: Committed to an Agile sprint-based model with clear deadlines and frequent review cycles.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Key findings:</strong> Risk evaluation revealed the need to reduce technical complexity and focus on emotional design. This directly influenced the decision to prioritise simplicity over novelty, ensuring stability and a usable experience by neurodivergent users.</p>

<h3 id="visual-design">Visual Design Choices</h3>
<p>The visual identity was intentionally designed to reduce overstimulation, while supporting clarity and structure. The colour palette combines muted tones to create a calm, inviting interface that avoids triggering ADHD users’ anxiety or distraction.</p>
<p>Each colour serves a role: blues and purples support emotional regulation, pink adds warmth, and white balances contrast and readability. Colours were tested for WCAG accessibility contrast.</p>

<h3 id="feedback">Final Feedback Summary</h3>
<p>Before finalising the solution, I gathered user feedback through prototype walkthroughs and surveys. Here's a summary of the most notable input and resolutions:</p>

<table class="feedback-table">
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>User Feedback</th>
      <th>Action Taken</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>“Completing tasks feels repetitive. Could it be more rewarding?”</td>
      <td>Introduced gamification elements like streak counters and achievement badges for motivation.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>“The progress bar at the bottom is easy to miss.”</td>
      <td>Moved the progress bar to a sticky top position with subtle animation to keep users aware of task flow.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>“Some colour combinations are hard to read or too intense.”</td>
      <td>Refined the palette to use calmer, ADHD-friendly tones with improved contrast ratios.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>“It would be nice to have calming videos or content to take breaks with.”</td>
      <td>Added an optional ‘Break Room’ section with curated therapeutic videos and guided breathing sessions.</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

    <h3 id="solution">Final Solution</h3>
    <p>
    The final solution is a fully prototyped ADHD-focused productivity app designed with both functionality and calmness in mind. The experience begins with a validated login and sign-up process, ensuring new and existing users can access their accounts securely. After signing in, users are welcomed by a minimal dashboard. If no tasks are yet added, a friendly prompt with a hyperlink guides them to begin scheduling.
    </p>
    
    <p>
    Medication management is integrated directly into the app. Users can add medications by tapping the "Medication" button, which opens a form to enter details such as name, date, time and category. A built-in reminder system notifies users 15 minutes before their medication time, and an additional notification is sent if a medication is scheduled upon login.
    </p>
    
    <p>
    The core of the task system lies in the interactive calendar. Users can select any date to view or add tasks via the "New Event" option. Tasks are categorised (e.g. To-Do, Medication) and visually represented using colour codes (e.g. red for medication). Daily task views allow editing or deletion for flexibility and control.
    </p>
    
    <p>
    To support neurodivergent users' need for structure and sensory relief, the dashboard also includes access to calming videos and a visual progress bar. As tasks are ticked off, the bar fills to give a satisfying sense of progress. This gamified feedback loop encourages consistent engagement. Users can also easily logout from the same screen.
    </p>
    
    <p>
    Overall, the solution brings together accessibility, visual structure, personalisation and behavioural support to address the executive functioning challenges faced by ADHD users.
