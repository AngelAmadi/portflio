        <h3>Accessibility Research</h3>
        <p>
            We considered a wide range of user needs to ensure the touchscreen experience would be inclusive, intuitive and comfortable in a live event setting. This included users with visual impairments, neurodivergent users, non-native English speakers, older adults and people of different heights or physical abilities.

For visually impaired users, we focused on high-contrast text and background combinations, meeting WCAG 2.1 AA standards for readability. All touchpoints featured large, legible typography and generous spacing to support ageing eyes and low vision conditions.

We also considered the physical ergonomics of the touchscreen, designing tap targets to be comfortably reachable for users of varying heights.  Clear iconography paired with concise text and avoided overly animated or overwhelming transitions</p>

        <h3>Personas & Final Iteration</h3>
        <p>Persona mapping helped shape the interface. Final refinements included accessible text sizing, large tap targets and branding consistency across screens.</p>

        <h3>Final UI Design</h3>
        <p>The final user interface was a result of iterative feedback, stakeholder input and accessibility-led refinements. It offered a clean, modular layout optimised for large touchscreen displays, using high-contrast IBM blues, intuitive icons and legible typography. Interaction cues were placed consistently, with large tap zones, minimal scrolling and a responsive layout to accommodate various heights and reach capabilities. Animated transitions were kept subtle to support smooth interaction without distraction. The interface allowed users to browse event agendas, read speaker profiles and filter content easily, even in a high-traffic environment.</p>

        <h3>Handover to Developers</h3>
        <p>To ensure a smooth transition from design to development, a comprehensive handover package was prepared. This included annotated redlines in Figma detailing layout, padding, interactive states and component behaviour. Assets were exported in appropriate formats and aligned to IBM’s Carbon Design System. A documentation guide accompanied the visual specs, outlining content structure, fallback logic, and accessibility requirements. Regular check-ins with the development team helped validate that spacing, contrast, font sizes and visual rhythm were consistently applied in the build, supporting WCAG 2.1 AA standards.</p>

        <h3>Design Lifecycle & Branding</h3>
        <p>The design process followed a structured lifecycle of research, ideation, prototyping, validation and refinement. We began with collaborative sketching, developed mid-fidelity flows, then moved into high-fidelity mockups that aligned tightly with IBM’s design principles. Testing and internal walkthroughs at each stage ensured alignment with accessibility, branding and functionality. Every component, from button style to spacing scale, was selected based on IBM’s established guidelines. Typography hierarchy used IBM Plex Sans, colour palettes respected visual contrast standards, and motion patterns followed brand interaction guidance. The result was a polished and scalable product that maintained coherence across screens and touchpoints.</p>
